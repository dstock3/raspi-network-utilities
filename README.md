This is a Node.js server-side package that leverages the Pi-Hole API to retrieve data from a Pi-hole DNS server. It uses the Express library to define endpoints for the API, and Axios to make GET requests to the Pi-hole API.

It starts by requiring the necessary dependencies: Express, Dotenv, and Axios. The Dotenv library is used to load environment variables defined in a .env file, and Express is used to define and handle the API routes. Axios is used to make GET requests to the Pi-hole API.

A function called proccessEndpoint is defined to generate the endpoint URL to be used in the Axios GET request. It takes in 3 parameters: queryType which specifies the type of query to be made, pw which is the password for the Pi-hole API, and endpoint which is the base URL of the Pi-hole API. It returns the complete endpoint URL, including the query type and authentication password.

Another function called processRoute is defined, which takes in queryType as a parameter and uses the proccessEndpoint function to generate the endpoint URL, then uses Axios to make a GET request to the Pi-hole API and returns the response data.

An object apiFunctions is defined, which lists various endpoints for the Pi-hole API and their corresponding descriptions, routes, and whether they are nested (i.e., whether the response data is nested within another object).

A for-loop iterates over the keys of the apiFunctions object and uses the Express library to define the API routes. For each endpoint, if it is nested, the processRoute function is called and the nested data is sent as a response to the client. If it is not nested, the response will be the entire data returned from the processRoute function.

Finally, the Express app is started on the specified port, which is either taken from the PORT environment variable or defaulted to 3000, and logs a message indicating that the server is running.
